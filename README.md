# svg_to_png
Windows Batch File for multi-export from Inkscape

DESCRIPTION:
.bat file to export multiple images from .svg to .png using Inkscape in Windows (using command prompt commands)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Place the .svg files you want to export in the same directory as the .bat file (i.e. in the same folder);
Double-click the .bat file and wait for all files to be exported (for many files it may take a few moments);
Note: Resolution is defined at 600 dpi. To alter this open the .bat file with Notepad, change the corresponding number, and save.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If no error messages appear and files are not exported, download the most updated version of Inkscape (but first uninstall the older version).
