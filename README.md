# .svg to .png

DESCRIPTION:
Windows Batch File (.bat) for multi-export from Inkscape: export multiple images from .svg to .png using Inkscape in Windows 10 (using command prompt commands).

INSTRUCTIONS:
1 - Place the .svg files you want to export in the same directory as the .bat file (i.e. in the same folder);
2 - Double-click the .bat file and wait for all files to be exported (for many files it may take a few moments).

NOTE:
Resolution is defined at 600 dpi. To alter this open the .bat file with a text editor (like Notepad), change the corresponding number, and save.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
Check Inkscape's installation directory is correct on the .bat file.
If no error messages appear and files are not exported, download the most updated version of Inkscape (but first uninstall the older version).
